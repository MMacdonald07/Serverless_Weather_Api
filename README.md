# Serverless_Weather_Api

This API is built using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, using the serverless framework for deployment. 
By combining the mapbox geocoding API and the openweathermap API, enables the user to get weather information for a given location [here](https://smo8k1u4lc.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/london).
Returned data includes the current forecast, latitudinal and longitudinal position of search and the wind speed.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your machine using https://github.com/MMacdonald07/Serverless_Weather_Api.git

### Setup

Use the package manager npm to install prerequisite node dependencies so the program can run:

```bash
npm install
```

Additionally, API keys will need to be generated by making an account on:
* [Geocoder](https://www.mapbox.com/)
* [Forecaster](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Usage

To do this, it will be necessary to have an [AWS](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=eu-west-2#) account 
and a [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) account to generate API keys for deployment.

From here, run the following in the terminal to build and deploy the program:

```bash
npm run all
```

### Testing
